# Thesis-on-Image-analysis-of-biomedical-data
This repository is dedicated for my Thesis work on Image analysis of biomedical data, where i have used various Open CV algorithms like Haris corner detection, Adaptive Thresholding and Brute force Image comparison were implemented to determine the mast cells that primarily affects the skin by using mast cell images.

I have also uplaoded the macro script from Fiji bioimage analysis tool along with the results.
